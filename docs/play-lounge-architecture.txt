Play Lounge Architecture Plan

Goal
- Build a single-device "PlayStation Home" inspired hub in Next.js 14 with Tailwind.
- Support multiple party games, starting with Truth or Dare.

Tech Stack
- Next.js 14+ with App Router and TypeScript.
- React 18, Client Components for interactive game modules.
- Tailwind CSS 3.4 for styling; CSS variables for neon/PS5 aesthetic.
- Local state + localStorage hydration for player lists/per-game settings.

Structure
- Root layout provides global background, radial gradient, and top nav (logo + session controls placeholder).
- Home hub at `app/page.tsx` renders "carousel" like UI:
  * Hero area with featured game
  * Horizontal scroll of GameTiles; arrow keys / pointer for selection (initially click only, but accessible markup for future keyboard support).
  * Uses `lib/games.ts` to pull metadata (slug, name, tagline, status, accent color).
- Dynamic game routes under `app/games/[slug]/page.tsx`.
- Reusable UI primitives in `components/ui` (GlassCard, Button, NeonHeading, SpinnerWheel).
- Each game has its own component folder under `components/games/<slug>` plus data in `data/<slug>/`.

Truth or Dare Module
- Single-page experience with three panels:
  * Player Lobby: add/remove names, toggle auto-rotate or manual order.
  * Spinner Stage: Play button triggers wheel animation (Truth vs Dare) + selects next player.
  * Prompt Reveal: shows the prompt with actions (new prompt, mark as completed, swap type).
- Data: `data/truth-or-dare.ts` exports `truthPrompts`, `darePrompts`, curated for PG-13 fun.
- State Machine (client component):
  * `idle` -> `spinning` -> `revealed`.
  * After reveal, allow `Next Round` resets to `idle` selecting next player.
- Visuals: radial gradient background, animated wheel (CSS transform), confetti optional (future).

Extensibility
- Games registry typed with shared interface so adding new games just requires metadata + route component.
- Hook `usePartyPlayers` manages names and stores in localStorage.
- Utility `pickRandom<T>(array, historySet?)` ensures recent prompts not repeated.

Roadmap After Truth or Dare
- Add new games by creating `components/games/<new>` and hooking into `games.ts`.
- Add achievements overlay, session persistence, audio cues.

Dev Notes
- Provide scripts in package.json, ESLint + Tailwind config ready for `npm install`.
- README to guide running `npm install` then `npm run dev`.
- Keep assets ASCII-friendly; no external images initially.
