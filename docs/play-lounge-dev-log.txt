[2025-09-29 10:35] Project Kickoff
Purpose: Build a single-device Next.js party hub inspired by PlayStation Home, delivering multiple couch-friendly games. First playable module: Truth or Dare with spinner and prompt management.
Constraints: Runs on one PC offline; no multi-device sync yet. Target stack Next.js 14 App Router, Tailwind, TypeScript. Deployment not yet considered.
Initial Brainstorming:
- Central hub with neon/space aesthetic, tiles for each game.
- Games share player roster and localStorage persistence.
- Truth or Dare MVP requires player queue, truth/dare wheel, prompt randomizer, completion tracking.
- Future games can plug into registry (e.g., Drawing Telephone, Rapid Dare Wheel variant, Wavelength Lite).
Planning Notes:
- Scaffold new Next.js app under `play-lounge/` (separate from repo root).
- Create reusable UI components (glass panels, neon headings, buttons).
- Organize prompts in `data/truth-or-dare.ts` for reuse.
- Implement hooks for player management and prompt rotation.
- Document all architectural decisions and evolution in this log.
Next Actions:
1. Manual scaffold (or `create-next-app`) within `play-lounge/` directory.
2. Configure Tailwind, TypeScript, ESLint.
3. Implement hub page shell + Truth or Dare route skeleton.

[2025-09-29 10:50] Architecture Outline Snapshot
Play Lounge Architecture Plan

Goal
- Build a single-device "PlayStation Home" inspired hub in Next.js 14 with Tailwind.
- Support multiple party games, starting with Truth or Dare.

Tech Stack
- Next.js 14+ with App Router and TypeScript.
- React 18, Client Components for interactive game modules.
- Tailwind CSS 3.4 for styling; CSS variables for neon/PS5 aesthetic.
- Local state + localStorage hydration for player lists/per-game settings.

Structure
- Root layout provides global background, radial gradient, and top nav (logo + session controls placeholder).
- Home hub at `app/page.tsx` renders "carousel" like UI:
  * Hero area with featured game
  * Horizontal scroll of GameTiles; arrow keys / pointer for selection (initially click only, but accessible markup for future keyboard support).
  * Uses `lib/games.ts` to pull metadata (slug, name, tagline, status, accent color).
- Dynamic game routes under `app/games/[slug]/page.tsx`.
- Reusable UI primitives in `components/ui` (GlassCard, Button, NeonHeading, SpinnerWheel).
- Each game has its own component folder under `components/games/<slug>` plus data in `data/<slug>/`.

Truth or Dare Module
- Single-page experience with three panels:
  * Player Lobby: add/remove names, toggle auto-rotate or manual order.
  * Spinner Stage: Play button triggers wheel animation (Truth vs Dare) + selects next player.
  * Prompt Reveal: shows the prompt with actions (new prompt, mark as completed, swap type).
- Data: `data/truth-or-dare.ts` exports `truthPrompts`, `darePrompts`, curated for PG-13 fun.
- State Machine (client component):
  * `idle` -> `spinning` -> `revealed`.
  * After reveal, allow `Next Round` resets to `idle` selecting next player.
- Visuals: radial gradient background, animated wheel (CSS transform), confetti optional (future).

Extensibility
- Games registry typed with shared interface so adding new games just requires metadata + route component.
- Hook `usePartyPlayers` manages names and stores in localStorage.
- Utility `pickRandom<T>(array, historySet?)` ensures recent prompts not repeated.

Roadmap After Truth or Dare
- Add new games by creating `components/games/<new>` and hooking into `games.ts`.
- Add achievements overlay, session persistence, audio cues.

Dev Notes
- Provide scripts in package.json, ESLint + Tailwind config ready for `npm install`.
- README to guide running `npm install` then `npm run dev`.
- Keep assets ASCII-friendly; no external images initially.

[2025-09-29 11:05] Scaffold Progress
- Created dedicated Next.js app directory \play-lounge/\ with manual scaffold mirroring create-next-app (package.json, tsconfig, next.config.ts, Tailwind + PostCSS setup, .gitignore).
- Implemented App Router skeleton: global layout with Lexend font, radial neon background, hub home page with featured game tiles, dynamic game route handler.
- Added reusable UI primitives (GlassCard, Button, HubHeader, GameTile) with Tailwind neon styling.
- Built Truth or Dare module (prompt data, player roster hook, animated spinner, prompt reveal actions).
- Seeds include future game placeholders in games registry for easy expansion.
- Pending: testing interaction states in browser, hooking up confetti/audio polish, populating additional games after truth-or-dare sign-off.




[2025-09-29 11:20] Config fix -> Converted next.config.ts to next.config.mjs because Next.js CLI only accepts JS/MJS configs.
[2025-09-29 11:24] TS config fix -> Corrected escaped path key in tsconfig.json ("@/*") so Next.js TypeScript verification can parse JSON.
[2025-09-29 11:32] Encoding fix -> Rewrote package.json and tsconfig.json with UTF-8 encoding so Next.js can parse configuration files.
[2025-09-29 11:38] Encoding fix -> Rewrote package.json and tsconfig.json without UTF-8 BOM so Next.js webpack JSON parsing succeeds.
[2025-09-29 11:55] Navigation -> Added in-game "Back to Lounge" link and tagline banner on game pages so players can return to the hub without browser controls.
[2025-09-29 12:05] Repo tidy -> Moved docs/ and sleepover-game-ideas.txt inside play-lounge per new workspace structure.
[2025-09-29 12:12] Repo docs -> Added project README and standardized .gitignore in play-lounge after git init.
[2025-09-29 12:25] UI polish -> Marked wheel segments as relative containers so Truth/Dare labels no longer overlap.
[2025-09-29 12:40] Bugfix -> Stabilized Truth or Dare spin cycle (timeout cleanup, functional rotation updates, history refs) and updated remove button icon.
